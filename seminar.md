# Public AI Seminar

A research seminar to study public AI and other forms of public interest AI.

## Season 2
Season 2 will run through August and September, starting on August 13, 2024 and concluding on October 8. The final schedule will be posted in early August.

For the fall of 2024, we will focus especially on connecting and relating a cluster of political narratives around public AI, including responsible/safe AI, public compute, sovereign/national AI, democratic AI, open source AI, and AI for science.

## Goals
The Public AI Seminar has two parallel objectives: 
- To develop a body of research, ideas, and tools to support the development of public AI and other forms of public interest AI.
- To foster an intellectual community capable of describing, guiding, and implementing public AI and other forms of public interest AI.

Over the course of the seminar, we will consider different models of public AI, lessons from both history and from AI, general theories of public investment and of regulation, as well as many different arguments for and against public AI. Four themes will guide our considerations: public benefit, public accountability, market failure, and political narratives.
