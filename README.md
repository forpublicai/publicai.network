## What is public AI?

Public AI is **AI as public infrastructure**: AI provisioned like electricity, parks, highways, libraries, or the Internet itself.

- Public AI is **publicly accessible**: ensuring AI delivers benefits to all.
- Public AI is **publicly accountable**: ensuring AI reflects society's values.
- Public AI creates **permanent public goods**: ensuring AI is a reliable foundation.
- Public AI is being designed and built **right now** - all around the world.

## Why do we need public AI?

- Limited public capacity in AI is stifling our collective capacity to shape the direction of society.
- AI is becoming essential infrastructure, like roads and water pipelines - fitting for the public sector.
- AI systems are growing in power and should reflect society's values, not the values of shareholders.
- Private companies have a head start - without investment in public capacity now, the gap will grow.

## Who we are

The **Public AI Network** is a coalition working to bring about public AI. We aim to:

- Ensure public capacity-building is part of the conversation about AI design, policy, and funding
- Make it easier to build public AI by coordinating research efforts in the ML community
- Support policymakers and technical teams seeking to implement public AI
- Organize the movement for public AI

We host a Slack community which connects together experts from leading public AI projects, thinktanks, and civil society groups. We also host a regular [seminar series](https://publicai.network/seminar) that shares insights from leaders in the field such as [Yoshua Bengio](https://archive.org/details/public-ai-bengio), [Diane Coyle](https://archive.org/details/public-ai-coyle), and [Lawrence Lessig](https://archive.org/details/public-ai-lessig).
