description: Recruiting AI experts to support better public procurement decisions
---

Public procurement systems and staffers are asking for expert guidance as they work to make individual procurement decisions on AI-native products, as well as develop an understanding of the best policies, contract clauses, and decision criteria to use when evaluating new technology products, services, and initiatives. Public AI is recruiting a corps of AI experts from academia and the private and public sectors to serve as an on-call resource for governments engaging with these complex issues. We're particularly interested in finding experts who have the capacity to share knowledge about open source tools, systems and strategies, which the Public AI team finds to be integrally linked to the success of fair, public AI access.  Learn more about the connections between Public AI and open source strategies here: [If open source is to win, it must go public](https://arxiv.org/html/2507.09296v1).

## What is public procurement?

Governments at all levels use public procurement processes to purchase or secure goods, services and technology. Procurement processes were originally developed to forestall biased awarding of public funds, and procurement plays an important role in ensuring a fair contracting process. Governments' standard procurement processes may be challenged when asked to evaluate or purchase new types of technology. Currently, procurement teams are seeking help in understanding and managing AI-related issues.

## What Is Public AI?

Public AI is AI as public infrastructure—like public parks, highways, electricity, and yes, libraries. It's **open, accountable, and sustainably maintained**, with access available to all.

> “In labs, libraries, and legislatures around the world, the work to reignite our shared imagination by building Public AI has already begun.” — *Public AI White Paper (2024)*
