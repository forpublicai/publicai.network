## Goals
The Public AI Seminar has two parallel objectives: 
- To develop a body of research, ideas, and tools to support the development of public AI and other forms of public interest AI.
- To foster an intellectual community capable of describing, guiding, and implementing public AI and other forms of public interest AI.

Over the course of the seminar, we will consider different models of public AI, lessons from both history and from AI, general theories of public investment and of regulation, as well as many different arguments for and against public AI. Four themes will guide our considerations: public benefit, public accountability, market failure, and political narratives.
