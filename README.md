> Public AI: powerful new infrastructures for the common good.

## What is public AI?

- Public AI is **accessible**: ensuring AI delivers benefits to all.
- Public AI is **accountable**: ensuring AI reflects society's values.
- Public AI is **sustainably public**: ensuring AI will remain a public good.
- Public AI is being designed and built **right now** - all around the world.

## Why do we need public AI?

- Limited public capacity in AI is stifling our collective capacity to shape the direction of society.
- AI is becoming essential infrastructure, like roads and water pipelines - fitting for the public sector.
- AI systems are growing in power and should reflect society's values, not the values of shareholders.
- Private companies have a head start - without investment in public capacity now, the gap will grow.

## Who we are

The **Public AI Network** is a coalition working to bring about public AI. Our aims are to:

- Ensure public capacity-building is part of the conversation about AI design, policy, and funding
- Make it easier to build public AI by coordinating research efforts in the ML community
- Support policymakers and technical teams seeking to implement public AI
- Organize the movement for public AI
